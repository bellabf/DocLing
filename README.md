## Overview

Our approach showcases a pipeline designed to leverage the power of Cohere's NLP model for natural language processing tasks. This includes:
- Preprocessing text data
- Creating embeddings
- Implementing a language understanding or generation task
- Evaluating model outputs


## Requirements

Before running the scripts in your local system, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Cohere Python SDK (`cohere`)
- Other necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`

## Installation

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemhemoh/DocLing.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Obtain an API key from [Cohere](https://cohere.ai) and set it up in the notebook.
4. Run the below command:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Approach Description

The approach follows these main steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Loads and preprocesses text data for NLP tasks.
2. **Embedding Generation:** Utilizes Cohereâ€™s model to create embeddings for text inputs.
3. **Model Usage:** Demonstrates how to perform tasks like text classification, semantic search, or text generation using the Cohere API.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance based on the specific NLP task.
